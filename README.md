# zencalmeque theme

This theme got it's start in Textmate and the Zenburnesque theme.  It's a "calmed down" variation of
that theme with number of different colors reduced as well as generally muting the intensity of
the original theme's color choices.  Some of the color choices in this theme trace
their roots back to Borland Turbo Pascal and Delphi days, especially, the comments, reserved keywords,
constants, strings, etc.  Over the years (decades) as the color choices evolved from a mere 16 to 256 and more, I've adapted my color preferences and this theme is pretty much where I am with my
editor colors for Atom, VIM, TextMate, etc.
